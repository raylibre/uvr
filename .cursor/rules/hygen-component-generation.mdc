# Component Generation with Hygen

All new components **must** be created using the Hygen code generator to ensure consistency with project standards and templates.

## How to Generate a Component

1. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run cc
   ```
   This will start the Hygen generator using the templates in the `_templates/create/component` directory.

2. Follow the prompts to specify the component name and any other required details.

3. The generator will scaffold the component files (e.g., `.vue`, `.scss`, `index.ts`) according to the project's conventions.

## Why Use Hygen?
- Ensures all components follow the same structure and code style
- Reduces manual errors and setup time
- Keeps the codebase maintainable and consistent

> **Rule:** If you need to create a new component, you **must** use Hygen via `npm run cc` and never create component files manually.
